# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is supported with security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of these options:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
2. Private maintainer contact configured in repository settings

When reporting, include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested remediation if available

We will acknowledge valid reports as quickly as possible and work on a fix
before public disclosure.
